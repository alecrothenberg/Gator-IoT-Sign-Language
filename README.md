# Gator-IoT-Sign-Language

A Real-Time Sign Language translator that takes the ESP32 camera as input and uses a Computer Vision model using Scikit-learn, Open-CV, and Media Pipe to convert the stream data into text.
This is then sent to our realtime database which our chat application website and other ESP32 module configured with an LCD screen receives the translated data.
