        <h3 style={{textAlign:'center'}}>
            Around the world there are about 1.5 billion people who suffer from some form of hearing loss.
            Many of these individuals then learn some form of sign language to communicate. While 
            many people know sign language, there are many more who do not. This poses many communication issues
            to those who are hard of hearing. To combat this, we have created an interface that can detect and 
            interpret sign language characters. This allows individuals to communicate and bridge the language gap!
